# Window Functions Generator

Project Description:
I proposed a tool for transforming functions into window functions, which are
zero-valued except a specific interval, and visualizing the resulting window functions.
When the interval is around zero, resulting functions will become low-pass filters.

Demo:
Six different functions were transformed to window functions.
For further detailed information, please check the Demo file.
